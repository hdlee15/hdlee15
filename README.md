- 👋 Hi, I’m @hdlee15
- 👀 I’m interested in water resource management and evaluation of water reporting measures as they are concerned with expressing drought conditions, particularly in Washington State.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop R packages to scrub and colate streamflow statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing language to help assess streamflow modeling.
